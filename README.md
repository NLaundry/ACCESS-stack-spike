# Issues to Resolve

- pydantic isn't being found by pyright right now ... not sure why.
- could be that pydantic isn't in the pyproject toml but it should still be picked up by the virtual env
- could be that pyright's finding it but vim isn't

after installing pydantic, prisma breaks. 
Okay so something weird happened with the venv file - deleting with rm -rf .venv fixed things
- this really points to how it's a great idea to have venv folders IN PROJECT so you don't have this mystical venv in some shared folder elsewhere.
